# K2E7_Utils
A collection of utilities I personally developed and use for my own work. 

Also includes a generic installer that 'installs' said utils in the system to be called from any directory/folder and does the intended function. 

For the sake of not running it mistakenly none of the utils will execute on just being called, one would need to add flags to make them work 
( I find it useful to add this breaker as I can subconsciously delete something useful ). Calling the script explicitly just shows what flags it supports.
